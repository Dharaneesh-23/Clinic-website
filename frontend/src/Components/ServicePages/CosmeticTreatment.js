        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Cosmetic treatment refers to a range of medical and non-medical procedures aimed at enhancing or altering one's appearance. These treatments can be performed on the skin, hair, teeth, and other parts of the body. Cosmetic treatments can include surgical procedures like facelifts, rhinoplasty (nose reshaping), and liposuction, as well as non-surgical treatments such as Botox injections, dermal fillers, laser hair removal, and chemical peels.
